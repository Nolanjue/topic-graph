we use cosine similaritry matrix and then create edges based on result of the matrix(we can calculate this)
each chunk should already have a topic


for the whole text we should 
FOR LDA: we should map each chunk to a separate topic

LDA go through the entire text ->generate topics, we will choose the top 3-4 topics

after we generate topics, we add it to topic array(from previous iterations of LDA)

We will try to force it. to only generates probabilities for chunks with those topics
